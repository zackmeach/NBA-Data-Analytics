## Setup
To get started, clone the GitHub directory to your local machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zackmeach/NBA-Data-Analytics
```
Next, create a branch of the main code to work on:
```
$ git checkout -b zack_branch
Switched to a new branch 'test'
```
Now that you have your own branch, you are free to make whatever changed you want to the directory without affecting the main branch. You can check your current status as follows:
```
$ git status
On branch zack_branch
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
Once you are finished editing your directory, you can send the files to the GitHub repository by doing the following:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "this text describes my changes"
$ git push origin zack_branch
```
